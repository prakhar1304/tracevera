# 🚀 TraceVera – Public Project Transparency on the Blockchain

TraceVera is a decentralized, blockchain-based platform built on the Polygon network to promote transparency and accountability in publicly funded government projects. By leveraging smart contracts and decentralized tracking, TraceVera enables governments to monitor the allocation, progress, and completion of projects handled by contractors.

## 🌐 Overview

Governments allocate millions in public funds for infrastructure and development projects. However, a lack of transparency often leads to inefficiencies, delays, or misuse of funds. **TraceVera** solves this problem by offering an immutable, decentralized tracking system that ensures transparency and trust at every stage.

## 🏗 Key Features

- ✅ **Project Tracking** – Register, monitor, and update project milestones on-chain.
- 🔗 **Smart Contracts** – Govern interactions between government bodies and contractors.
- 💼 **Contractor Onboarding** – Transparent contractor registration and project assignment.
- 📊 **Progress Updates** – Real-time updates on project milestones, completion, and fund disbursement.
- 🧾 **Immutable Records** – All activities are recorded on the Polygon blockchain.
- 👁️ **Public Transparency Portal** – Citizens can view the status and spending of projects.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Blockchain Layer**: [Polygon (Matic)](https://polygon.technology/)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity, Hardhat
- **Frontend**: React / Next.js (or Expo if mobile)
- **Backend**: Node.js (if applicable)
- **Database (Optional)**: IPFS / PostgreSQL (for off-chain metadata)
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask / WalletConnect

## 📜 Smart Contract Modules

- `ProjectRegistry.sol` – Registers and manages all public projects
- `ContractorManager.sol` – Handles contractor verification and assignments
- `MilestoneTracker.sol` – Tracks progress updates and milestone verification
- `FundsDisbursement.sol` – Ensures fund release only on milestone completion

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Government agency registers a new project with metadata and fund allocation.
2. A contractor is assigned via the smart contract.
3. Milestones are defined and tracked.
4. Each completed milestone is submitted and validated.
5. Upon validation, funds are disbursed via the smart contract.
6. All activity is permanently stored on the blockchain for public audit.
